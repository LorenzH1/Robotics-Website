                            I strive to be as knowledgeable of the world around me,<br> this usually includes: technologies, mechanics, and the
                            history of things.<br> I would like to study at the Ohio State University<br> to become a computer programmer who<br> specializes
                            in working with robots.<br> I am interested in studying for that because of the salary<br> and the fact that I am working at a
                            job<br> that revolves in everything that I love to do.<br></p>

                        <p>I joined the Robotics Club because I love building robots and<br> developing a series of code/instructed language for them to execute. <br>
                            My drive for fixing or creating something entirely new was an extraordinary feeling,<br> this made me want to join Robotics so that I can apply<br>
                            these skills into a wholesome purpose.<br> I also believe that the future for the world will become more<br> technological and more intuituve, so I wanted to gain as much<br>
                            knowledge as possible to be prepared.</p>
