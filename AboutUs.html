                            <p>Hello there, my name is Lorenz Henry, I am 13 years old, and I am currently in the eighth grade at Bellefontaine Middle School, this is also my first year of robotics. I strive to be as knowledgeable of the world around me, this usually includes technologies, mechanics, and the history of things. I would like to study at the Ohio State University to become a computer programmer who specializes in collaborating with robots. I am interested in studying for that because of the salary and the fact that I am working at a job that revolves in everything that I love to do.</p>

                            <p>I joined the Robotics Club because I love building robots and developing a series of code/instructed language for them to execute. My drive for fixing or creating something entirely new was an extraordinary feeling, this made me want to join Robotics so that I can apply these skills into a wholesome purpose. I also believe that the future for the world will become more technological and more intuitive, so I wanted to gain as much knowledge as possible to be prepared.</p>
